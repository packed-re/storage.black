ENCRYPTION SCHEME
iv (optional) + hmac salt + hmac + ciphertext 
cipher header size with iv - 56 bytes
	without iv - 40 bytes (typically the stuff thats received from the client)

RESPONSE SCHEME
	- 1 byte containing (custom) response code
	- variable size data


Account is created only once a file is uploaded or once an activation code is used


GET /session
- Field "session". Session token retrieved from POST /sessions, in base64.
Returns encryption key for account data. Returns the byte 0 if expired.

POST /session
- Field "age". Time in seconds of how long the session should stay valid for. If 0 session never expires.
Returns a session token and encryption key for account data.
	- encryption_key - 32 bytes
	- token - atleast 48 bytes

POST /file
(in $_FILES)
- Access
	- account_id - 32 bytes 		// (ideally this should be uploaded encrypted with the session encryption key, without padding)
	- action_type - 1 byte (contains the code of the desired action to take. 0 to get contents, in which case FileContent is not provided, or 1 to upload data)
			// - session_token - 48 bytes realistically, but should always be sent last so as to leave the possibility of adding data to the session token in the future
- FileHeader
	- write_offset - 8 bytes
	- file_size - 8 bytes
	- encryption_key - 48 bytes (16 (iv) + 32 (enc key)) (this should be uploaded with no padding from the client)
	- file_data - up to 512 bytes (this is the metadata)
- FileContent
	- the raw content thats to be written to disk - variable size
